# Avoid it!
Based on an game alled "Axe", i created my own version of it using raylib library.

Compile on Unix:
```
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
```
Windows - Sadly, I was unable to compile with project on an windows pc and through mingw32 command on linux. Will update when i find a solution
