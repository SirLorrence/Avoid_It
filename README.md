# Avoid it!
Based on an game called "Axe", i created my own version of it using raylib library.

Compile on Unix:
```
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
```
Windows - Sadly, I was unable to compile with project on an windows pc and through mingw32 command on linux. Will update when i find a solution

First I struggle on how to install the library, I could of just used the zip file but I wanted to create this from starch. I followed the github wiki on installing it on linux and got stuck, but I found a video that help clearified what I was doing and managed to get an basic window to work.

When in was trying to pass in an variable to my movement input, at first it did not work. Then I remember cpp as points, so instead of passing in a variable - I passed in the memory addrease and that solve my problem. Pointers are pretty cool\
Example:
`` void Input(int& x, int& y, int speed) ``

Log #2 

I wanted to reoriginze my project, but to do that I couldnt use gcc anymore, well it gave me an ‘fatal error’. Now I started to learn how to create an cmake file.

After getting more errors, I went back to gcc because the cmake method didn’t work with the why I had raylibs install(maybe). I searched around an found that I had an extra / in front of the folder I was trying to compile from. Simple mistake but I also learned that you can do /*file to compile all of them, cool.

I also ran into an issue when trying to link object files which changing to g++ to gcc turn out ti fix it. I had no reason until now to change but will be using this by default of any other project.


Log #3

Have a full day of googling, search forms and asking a question in the raylib community(still hoping for a solution) I was unable to do a cross platform build on Linux. But this lead me to start looking in on how to make a cmake file, still confused but I got something to work. I modified a example script that was in the repo and used the knowledge I learned the other day. Tested this out on my Mac and with an  std=c++11 + make —build build command I got my project up and run on Mac.
